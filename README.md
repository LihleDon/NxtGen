# NxtGen: AWS-Powered Data Solution  
A project simulating real-world AWS data engineering and architecture workflows.  

### Purpose  
This repository demonstrates my progress toward AWS Solutions Architect and Data Engineer certifications.  
Current focus: integrating AWS S3 and Python for data storage and processing.  
Future plans: Lambda automation and Redshift analytics.  

### Tech Stack  
- AWS S3 (file storage)  
- Python (data scripting)  
- Planned: Lambda, Redshift, IAM  

### Features  
- Basic S3 upload script (see `s3_upload.py`).  
- More to come as I deepen my AWS skills!
